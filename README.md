### Code Quality and Testing Commands

- `make fmt` - Runs ruff format, which automatically reformats Python files according to the style rules in `pyproject.toml`
- `make lint` - Runs ruff check --fix, which lints the code (checks for style errors, bugs, outdated patterns, etc.) and auto-fixes what it can.
- `make check` - Runs fmt and lint.
- `make type` - Currently disabled. Runs mypy, the static type checker, using the strictness settings from `pyproject.toml`. Mypy is a static type checker for Python, a dynamically typed language. Because static analysis cannot account for all dynamic runtime behaviors, mypy may report false positives which do no reflect actual runtime issues.
- `make test` - Runs pytest with reporting (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
